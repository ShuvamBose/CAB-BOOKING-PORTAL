# CAB-BOOKING-PORTAL:
This project aims to reduce the cost of traveling by implementing a special routing algorithm, namely the Floyd-Warshall algorithm (Dynamic Programming).

The algorithm is used to determine the shortest path from the source to the destination as chosen by the user.

User details required for booking are encrypted and stored locally in a text file.

Input validations are performed for every user-provided input.

Comments have been added throughout the code for improved understanding.

We have also included a feature for dynamic fare calculation based on weather conditions. Currently, a random() function is being used for this purpose.
